# pl4y-react-spring-demo
This is an app for educational purpose only. This application is made using Spring Boot and postGRE SQL to make the Resfull APIs. Then React JS is used to make the frond end. There is no login so just flip the value of "isEditor" of const user in App.js to see two different portals. This is not meant for sale and only educational purposes. For students, made by student.
